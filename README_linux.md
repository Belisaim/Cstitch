There is an Arch AUR package of cstitch available at
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cstitch-git/

The binary linux version of Cstitch available at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/cstitch/files/Cstitch/ was compiled
against a 32-bit static build of Qt 5.2.1 on Fedora 21 (so it
shouldn't matter if your system is 32 or 64 bit).

If the binary doesn't run on your linux system, your best bet is to
compile the source - see INSTALL_linux.md at
https://github.com/kleintom/Cstitch/blob/master/INSTALL_linux.md for
instructions.
