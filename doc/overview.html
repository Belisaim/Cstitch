<h1 class="note_title">A Note On DMC Color Names</h1>
<p>
  DMC is a well known manufacturer of floss (cross stitch thread).
    Each floss that DMC sells has a color name and code, but DMC
    doesn't provide color (RGB) values for their floss, so the colors
    you see associated with DMC color names in this program are best
    guess approximations of the floss color associated with a given
    DMC color name.  DMC does not endorse these associations and has
    nothing to do with this program, nor does this program
    particularly endorse DMC: they just seem to be one of the more
    available suppliers of floss.
</p>
</div>

<h1 id="overview" class="section">Overview</h1>

<p>
Cstitch turns an image into a cross stitch pattern and allows you to
edit the generated pattern.  The final product is a pdf of the cross
stitch pattern and a list of the colors in the pattern.
</p>

<p>
  The transformation is a four step process.
</p>

<div class="h2Div">
<h2>1. <a href="colorChooser.html"><i>Choose your colors</i></a>
<a href="colorChooser.html"><img src=":colorChooser_active.png" alt="active color chooser icon"/></a></h2>
<p>
  There are three modes for choosing the colors to appear in your
  pattern, including choosing your own colors from the original image,
  choosing the number of colors you want to use and having the program
  choose the colors for you, and the option of choosing all of your
  colors to be colors actually available as floss.  If you choose your
  colors and later decide you're unhappy with your choice, you can
  either simply choose again or you can edit your choices by hand in
  step 3.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h2Div">
<h2>2. <a href="colorCompare.html"><i>Compare color choices</i></a>
<a href="colorCompare.html"><img src=":colorCompare_active.png" alt="active color compare icon"/></a></h2>
<p>
  At this stage your original image has been transformed into a new
  image using your color choices.  This step is used to compare your
  new image with the original image or with other color choices you
  have already made in order to decide which colors you'd like to
  move forward with.  If you decide to change your choice simply go back to
  step 1 and try again.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h2Div">
<h2>3. <a href="square.html"><i>Square your image and edit</i></a>
<a href="square.html"><img src=":square_active.png" alt="active square icon" /></a></h2>
<p>
  Your colored image has now been transformed into a "squared" or
  "grided" image as in the final cross stitch pattern.  Here you can
  edit your pattern by changing colors and freehand drawing until
  you're satisfied.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h2Div">
<h2>4. <a href="pattern.html"><i>Create the pattern and edit</i></a>
<a href="pattern.html"><img src=":pattern_active.png" alt="active pattern icon" /></a></h2>
<p>
The squared color image has now had colors replaced with symbols,
which you can change from among those available.  When you're
satisfied with the symbols, save your pattern to a pdf.
</p>
</div>

<h1>Moving Between the Stages</h1>
<p>
 Each of the four stages has its own panel; to move between the panels
 (as they become available), you can either use the the sequence of
 four icons (shown above) that appears on the right side of the
 toolbar, or you can choose from the <i>Windows</i> menu.  The current
 panel's icon will always appear highlighted with a green border and
 those that haven't been activated yet will appear grayed out.
</p>

<h1>Zooming</h1>

<p>
The first three stages provide two sets of zooming operations.
The first set appears on the toolbar (and also from the <i>Image</i>
menu) and consists of a "Zoom to fit" option <img
src=":zoomToImage.png" alt="zoom to image icon"/> that zooms the image to be as large as
possible and still fit in the available space, a "Zoom to width"
option <img src=":zoomToWidth.png" alt="zoom to width icon" /> that zooms the image to fit the
available width, a "Zoom to height" option <img src=":zoomToHeight.png" alt="zoom to height icon"
/> that zooms the image to fit the available height, and an "Original
size" option <img src=":zoomToOriginal.png" alt="zoom to original icon" /> that zooms the image to
its original size.  (There's a caveat for square images - see <a
href="square#zoom_caveat">this</a> for details.)
</p>

<p>
The second set of zoom options is available from the <i>Image</i> menu
and consists of a "Zoom in" option <img src=":zoomIn.png" alt="zoom in icon" /> that
increases the zoom by a fixed amount and a "Zoom out"
option <img src=":zoomOut.png" alt="zoom out icon" /> that decreases the zoom by a fixed
amount.
</p>

<p>
In the last (pattern) stage, only the second set of options is
available, either from the toolbar or from the <i>Image</i> menu.  At
the pattern stage the zoom level of the image determines the size of
the symbols in the pdf pattern output, i.e. the size of a square in
the pdf pattern will be (approximately) the same size as a square
on the screen.  In all other stages the zoom level has no effect on
processing.
</p>

<h1>Saving images</h1>
<p>
You can save the active image at any time as a jpg, png, pdf, or any
of several other formats, by clicking on the save
icon <img src=":saveImage.png" alt="save image icon" /> on the toolbar or by choosing <i>Save
Image</i> from the <i>File</i> menu (not available from the first
panel since the only image there is the original!).
</p>

<p><b>Note: </b>Saving an image does <b>not</b> allow you to restore
that image after you've quit the program.  For that, read on to the
next section on saving projects.
</p>

<p><b>Technical Note: </b>Square and pattern images (from the square
edit and pattern edit stages) are handled internally by this program
in a way that makes it easy to zoom to very large sizes on screen
without using many resources, but if you request to <em>save</em> such
an image, then the program must request enough memory to hold the
entire image all at once.  At very large zoom levels this can require
requesting and working with a gigabyte or more of memory which,
depending on your computer's resources, could take anywhere from a
couple of seconds to tens of minutes for your computer to process,
leaving your computer bogged down in the meantime.
</p>
<p>
A warning message will appear if you attempt to save a large file,
telling you how much memory will be required, and you can then decide
whether to go ahead with the save or to cancel.  To be safe, if you
get such a warning and decide to save the image, you should first save
your project.
</p>

<h1 id="saveRestore">Saving and restoring projects</h1>
<p>
You can save your work at any time by clicking on the save project
icon <img src=":saveProject.png" alt="save project icon" /> on the toolbar or by
choosing <i>Save Project</i> (or <i>Save Project As</i>) from
the <i>File</i> menu.  "Project" here refers to all of the images in
all of the panels, as well as various settings in those panels.  We
reccomend saving your project with a .xst extension (myProject.xst,
for example), but you can use any filename you'd like, with or without
an extension.
</p>

<p><b>Note: </b>The only image contained in a saved project file is the
original image that started the project; all other images associated
with the saved project are restored from the original when the project
is reloaded.  This keeps project files small and portable, but means
longer load times spent regenerating images.  (That means that if
you've created images that you know you aren't going to use, it's best
to delete them before saving your project.)
</p>

<p>
To restore your work from a saved project file, just click on the open
project icon <img src=":openProject.png" alt="open project icon" /> on the toolbar or
choose <i>Open Project</i> from the <i>File</i> menu and open the
project file you saved above.
</p>

<h1 id="overview_keyboard_shortcuts">Keyboard shortcuts</h1>
<p>
In addition to keyboard shortcuts listed in the menus, you can press
"Ctrl+Enter" (i.e. hold down the control key and then press enter) at
any time to process the current stage and move on to the next.  Other
panel-specific keyboard shortcuts are
listed <a href="colorCompare.html#color_compare_keyboard_shortcuts">here</a>
for the color compare panel,
<a href="square.html#square_keyboard_shortcuts">here</a> for the square edit
panel, and
<a href="pattern.html#pattern_keyboard_shortcuts">here</a> for the pattern
edit panel.
</p>

<h1>Panel specific help</h1>
<p>
Selecting "Help" from the Help menu will always display help for
whichever of the four panels you're currently on.
