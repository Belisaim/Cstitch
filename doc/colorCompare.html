<h1 id="colorCompare">The Color Compare Panel</h1>&nbsp;
<img src=":colorCompare_active.png" />

<p>
The color compare panel allows you to compare your new image with the
original image and other images created from the <i>Color Chooser
Panel</i>.
</p>

<p>
This panel can show two images side by side; to choose which image is
shown on a given side, left or right, either choose from the
appropriate pull-down list on the toolbar (labelled <i>L:</i>
or <i>R:</i>), or choose from the list in the appropriate <i>Left
Image</i> or <i>Right Image</i> menu.  (You can't view the same image
on both sides, so you will only be able to change a side if you have
created more than one image from the <i>Color Chooser Panel</i>.)
</p>

<div class="h2Div">
<h2>Hiding and Showing Images</h2>
<p>
You can hide an image by unchecking the <i>Show image</i> box in the
appropriate left or right image menu - hiding one image will give the
other image as much room as possible.  Recheck the box to reshow the
image.
</p>

<p>
You can manually give one side of the viewer more room by dragging the
middle bar of the viewer to one side or the other.  To reset the bar
to the center, click on <i>Center splitter</i> in the <i>Image</i>
menu.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h2Div">
<h2>Deleting Images</h2>
<p>
If you choose <i>Delete image</i> from one of the image menus, the
image cannot be recovered.  You can't delete the original image.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h2Div">
<a id="color_compare_keyboard_shortcuts"></a>
<h2>Keyboard shortcuts</h2>
<p>
You can press "Shift + Left Arrow" (i.e. hold down the shift key and
then press the left arrow key) to make the left image active, "Shift +
Right Arrow" to make the right image active, "Shift + Up Arrow" to
move up in the image list for the active side, and "Shift + Down
Arrow" to move down in the image list for the active side.  The same
shortcuts apply in the square edit panel.
</p>
<p>
See the <a href="overview.html#overview_keyboard_shortcuts">overview</a>
for application-wide keyboard shortcut information.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h2Div">
<h2>Dual Scrolling</h2> 
<p>
By default, if scrollbars are necessary for
your images, scrolling one side will automatically scroll the other
side by the same amount.  You can turn this behavior off or on by
unchecking or checking the <i>Dual scrolling</i> box from
the <i>Image</i> menu.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h2Div">
<h2>Dual Zooming</h2> 
<p>
By default, zooming the active image will apply the same zooming to
the inactive image.  You can turn this behavior off or on by
unchecking or checking the <i>Dual zooming</i> box from the
<i>Image</i> menu.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h2Div">
<h2>Selecting the Squaring Parameters</h2> 
<p>
The processing that occurs in this step turns a smoothly colored image
into a "squared" image, as in the final pattern, where each square in
the image has just one color.  The manner in which the current image
is tranformed into a squared/patterned image depends on
the <i>squaring mode</i> and the <i>square size</i> setting.
</p>

<p>
The <i>square size</i> setting determines how large (in pixels) the
squares to be created will be.  The size is set using the number box
on the toolbar, and is allowed to have any value from 2 to 50.  The
choice of square size, along with your choice of cross stitch fabric,
will determine how large your final cross stitched piece will be - you
can use the <i>Dimension Computer</i> (under the <i>Image</i> menu) to
help you choose the correct square size based on your fabric type and
your desired final dimensions.
</p>

<p>
The color that goes in a particular box of the pattern image (referred
to as the <i>representative color</i> of that block below) is
determined by the <i>squaring mode</i>, for which there are two
possible values.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h3Div">
<h3>1. Median Mode [default]</h3> 
<p>
Under median mode, roughly speaking, the representative color of a
given block is chosen to be that color in the block that is "least
far" in total from all of the other colors in the block.  This can be
thought of as choosing the "most representative" color in a given
block, and generally gives the best results.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h3Div">
<h3>2. Mode Mode</h3>
<p>
Mode mode chooses the representative color of a given block to be the
color that appears most often in that block.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h2Div">
<h2>Proceeding to the Square Editing Panel</h2>
<p>
 Once you have chosen the <i>squaring mode</i> and <i>square</i>
size, <b>click on the image you wish to square</b> to select it and
then click the <i>Square</i> button on the toolbar, which will take
you to the <a href="square.html">Square Editing Panel</a>.  
</p>

<p>
You can return to this panel, change your options, and click Square as
many times as you like.
