<h1>A Note On DMC Color Names</h1>
<p>
  DMC is a well known manufacturer of floss (cross stitch thread).
    Each floss that DMC sells has a color name and code, but DMC
    doesn't provide color (RGB) values for their floss, so the colors
    you see associated with DMC color names in this program are best
    guess approximations of the floss color associated with a given
    DMC color name.  DMC does not endorse these associations and has
    nothing to do with this program, nor does this program
    particularly endorse DMC: they just seem to be one of the more
    available suppliers of floss.
</p>

<h1>The Color Choosing Panel</h1>&nbsp;
<img src=":colorChooser_active.png" />

<p>
Start a new project by opening a saved image from your files, either
by clicking the folder icon <img src=":openImage.png"> on the toolbar
or choosing <i>Open</i> from the <i>File</i> menu.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of this first step is to reduce the number of colors in
your image (typically hundreds of thousands) to a (typically much
smaller!) selection of colors that you'd like to use as floss colors
for the final pattern.  The manner in which that is accomplished is
determined by the "color selection mode", described next.
</p>

<div class="h2">
<h2>Choosing the Color Selection Mode</h2>
<p>
The color selection mode is chosen from the dropdown box on the
toolbar.  There are three modes to choose from:
</p>
</div>

<div class="h3">
<h3><i>Num colors to DMC [default]</i></h3>

<p>
In this mode the number of colors chosen is determined by two
processes: user selection and program selection.  User selection works
by clicking on a color in the original image: the program will
transform the clicked color into the closest matching DMC color and
add the DMC color to the <i>Clicked colors</i> list on the right hand
side of the window.  The other color selection process is done by the
program: set the <i>number</i> of DMC colors you would like the
program to choose from the box to the right of the <i>Color Selection
Mode</i> box.
</p>
<p>
The colors the program chooses are based on the frequency with which
colors in the original image appear, so it's possible that small but
important features (such as eye color, for example) may not have the
desired color after this step (this program can't recognize features
in your image, only colors).  Such features can be corrected by hand
in <a href="square.html">a later step</a>.  The program will choose
its colors so that there is no overlap with any colors you choose by
clicking.  <b>Thus the total number of colors chosen will be the sum
of the user-clicked colors and the number of program-selected
colors.</b>
</p>
<p>
The program chooses its colors when you click on the <i>Process</i>
button on the toolbar.  The list of all colors chosen will appear to
the right of the image at the next stage, or you can return to this
stage at any time to see the list of program chosen colors in
the <i>Generated colors</i> list to the right of the image.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note: </b>The major advantage of using the <i>Num colors to DMC</i>
mode is that it is guaranteed to produce colors that are available as
floss.  The disadvantage is that the colors selected all come from the
fixed pool of DMC colors (currently 428 colors).  One consequence is
that there may be no way to choose close shades of color from your
original image unless similar close shades already exist as DMC
colors.  The next mode gets around that by allowing you to select
exact colors from the original image (which may not be available as
floss!).
</div>

<div class="h3">
<h3><i>Num colors</i></h3>
<p>
This mode is similar to <i>Num colors to DMC</i> mode, except that any
color you click on will be added directly to the <i>Clicked colors</i>
list without being transformed to a DMC color first, and the colors
chosen by the program will all be colors actually occurring in the
image.
</p>
<p>
While this mode will generally result in new images that match the
original more closely than <i>Num colors to DMC</i> mode, the
disadvantage is that the colors used to produce the new images may not
be available as floss colors.  Nonetheless, you may want to use this
mode to produce an image to be used as the basis for adjusting the
results of a DMC-mode image.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h3">
<h3><i>DMC</i></h3>

<p>
<i>DMC</i> mode will create a new image by replacing each color in
your original image with the closest matching DMC color.  This
program is aware of 428 DMC color names, so depending on
the variety of colors in your original image, this mode can create a
new image with anywhere from 1 to 428 colors.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h2">
<p>
<b>Note: </b>The colors produced in this step aren't guaranteed to be
in the final image - chosen colors that appear relatively infrequently
could be removed by further processing at a later stage.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h2">
<h2>Proceeding to the Color Compare Panel</h2>
<p>
After you have chosen the <i>Color Selection Mode</i> and your colors
(or number of colors), click the <i>Process</i> button to continue to
the next step, the <a href="colorCompare.html"><i>Color Compare
Panel</i></a>.  You can come back to this panel, change your selection
mode, and click <i>Process</i> as many times as you want, and each
processed image will be available in the next panel, where you can
compare results.
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> This <i>color choosing</i> step performs mostly
  automated color selection.  A <a href="square.html">later</a> step
  will allow for editing "by hand" to change/add/delete colors.
