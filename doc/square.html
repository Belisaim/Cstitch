<h1>The Square Edit Panel</h1>&nbsp;
<img src=":squareImage_active.png" />

<p>
The square edit panel allows you to edit your pattern by changing
colors and freehand drawing.
</p>

<div class="h2">
<h2>Square Pattern Editing Tools</h2>
<p>
This panel provides four tools for editing your pattern by hand.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> You can't edit the original image using these tools, but
you can use the tools to choose colors from the original image.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h3">
<h3>Selection mode</h3>&nbsp;
<img src=":cursor.png" />
<p>
Click on the selection mode icon to be able to select an image with
the mouse (if other tools are active, a mouse click may mean something
else) - basically selection mode provides what you would think of as
standard mouse behavior, as opposed to the other tools.
</p>
<p>You can also select the left or right image at any time by using
the left image button <img src=":leftImage.png" /> or the right image
button <img src=":rightImage.png" /> on the toolbar.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h3">
<a name="change_a_color_tool"></a>
<h3>The Change a Color Tool</h3>&nbsp;
<img src=":changeAll.png" />
<p>
Use this tool to change a color in your image.  You can also change a
color by right clicking on it at any time in the color list and
choosing <i>Change color</i>.
</p>

<p>The color to be changed <i>to</i> is displayed in a color swatch
above the tools.  You can set that color in any of four ways:

<ul>
<li>Right click on a color on either image;</li>
<li>Middle click on either image to open the Color Dialog to choose a
color (with initial choices based on the colors in the image around
where you clicked) - see below for more information on the Color
Dialog options;</li>
<li>Click on the color swatch to set an arbitrary color;</li>
<li>Right click on the color you want in the color list and
choose <i>Set as tool color</i>.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Once the swatch color has been set, left click on a color in the
selected image to change it to the swatch color.
</p>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<div class="h2">
<h2>The Color Dialog</h2>

<p>
The color dialog offers up to five ways to choose a new color; you can
alternate between the options using the menu in the lower left corner.
</p>
<p>
If the <i>DMC colors only</i> box is checked on the tools dock then
the options below will only allow you to choose DMC colors.
</p>

<div class="h3">
<h3>Choose a Square Color</h3> 
<p>
If the square you click on contains more than one color <i>in the
original image</i> then this mode will allow you to choose from the
colors from the original image in the clicked square.
</p>
<p>
(If there is only one color in the original image from the square you
clicked then this option won't appear.)
</p>
</div>

<div class="h3">
<h3>Choose a List Color</h3>
<p>
Choose a color from those already present in the image.  The original
color clicked on is in the upper left hand corner and the rest of the
colors are arranged by rows from nearest to furthest from the original
color.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h3">
<h3>Choose a DMC Color</h3> 
<p>
With this option you can choose any DMC
color; colors are arranged in the same manner as for the <i>Choose a
List Color</i> option.
<p>
</div>

<div class="h3">
<h3>Choose From an Image</h3>
<p>
This option allows you to choose a color from any image currently on
view in the main panel.  The color block is arranged as follows: the
large rectangle on the left is the original color, the upper right
square is the most recently clicked color, and the lower right square
is the color the mouse is currently over.  Click on the new color you
want from an image and then click the <i>Accept</i> button to confirm
your choice - if you misclick simply click on a different color before
hitting the Accept button.
</p>
<p>
If you're in DMC only mode then the upper right square will always be
translated to a DMC color.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h3">
<h3>Choose a New Color</h3>
<p>
Use this option to choose a color from a color palette or by providing
an RGB or HSV value. 
</p>
<p>
In DMC only mode this option is unavailable.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="h3">
<h3>The Draw Tool</h3>&nbsp;
<img src=":draw.png" />
<p>
Use the draw tool to freehand draw on your image by holding down the
left mouse button while dragging the mouse.  The drawing color is
displayed in the color swatch above the tools.  You can set it as
described under the <i>Change a color tool</i> directions.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h3">
<h3>The Fill Region Tool</h3>&nbsp;
 <img src=":fill.png" /> 
<p>
Use the fill region tool to change the color of a specific region in
the image by left clicking in the region.  The new color is determined
just as for the <i>Change a color tool</i>.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h3">
<h3>The Detail Tool</h3>&nbsp;
 <img src=":detail.png" /> 
<p>
The detail tool is intended to be used to restore color to small
detail areas of an image that may not have received adequate treatment
from prior automated processing (the automated processing concentrates
mostly on picking out the most prominent colors).
</p>

<p>
To use the tool, left click/drag on the selected image over the region
you'd like to detail.  As you drag, the squares under the mouse will
be marked with xes.  To unmark individual marked squares, right
click/drag on the square(s), or click on the <i>Clear</i> button to
clear all of the marked squares.<br />
<b>Note:</b>The tool works best if you concentrate on individual
features you'd like to restore, i.e. it's better to mark and detail many
smaller regions of similar colors than to mark a single larger region
with many mixed features/colors.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Colors</i> selection box determines the maximum number of
colors that will be used to recolor the area that you've marked.  Once
you've marked an area and chosen the number of colors you'd like to
use, click the <i>Detail</i> button.  The new colors for the marked
region will be chosen from the colors on the original image in that
region, or DMC versions of those colors if the <i>DMC colors only</i>
box is checked.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h2">
<h2>Replace Rare Colors</h2>
<p>
Although this program makes an attempt to choose only colors that
appear frequently in the original image, you may still wind up with
several colors that appear in only a few squares in your square image.
To replace such colors with colors that appear more frequently,
choose <i>Replace rare colors</i> from the <i>Image</i> menu.  The
dialog that pops up allows you to define what &ldquo;rare&rdquo;
means in the top line, and then lists the rare colors in the image
along with the number of squares each occupies and what color (from
among the &ldquo;common&rdquo; colors already in the image) it will be
replaced with.  Colors from rows that are unchecked will not be
changed.  Click &ldquo;OK&rdquo; to replace the checked colors.  If
you decide you don't like the result you can always undo your work
(see below).
</p>
<p><b>Note: </b>Currently there is no way to change the color a rare
color will be changed <i>to</i>.  If you're unhappy with the program's
choice, one alternate option is to uncheck that color in the dialog
and then change it by hand using
the <a href="#change_a_color_tool"><i>Change a Color Tool</i></a>.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h2">
<h2>Edit Undo/Redo</h2>
<p>
You can undo and redo your edits using the edit
history buttons on the toolbar: undo <img src=":/leftArrow.png"> and
redo <img src=":rightArrow.png">.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h2">
<h2>Gridding and grid color</h2>
<p>
By default all pattern images in this panel have grid lines in black.
You can turn off the grid lines by either clicking the gridlines
button <img src=":grid.png" /> on the toolbar or by toggling
the <i>Grid</i> menu option in the <i>Image</i> menu.
</p>
<p>
In addition you can change the grid color by selecting <i>Change grid
color</i> from the <i>Image</i> menu.
</p>
<p>
Grid changes apply to all images simultaneously (so, for example, you
can't turn on the grid on the left image and turn it off on the right
image).
</p>
</div>

<div class="h2">
<a name="keyboard_shortcuts"></a>
<h2>Keyboard shortcuts</h2>
<p>
You can press "Shift + Left Arrow" (i.e. hold down the shift key and
then press the left arrow key) to make the left image active, "Shift +
Right Arrow" to make the right image active, "Shift + Up Arrow" to
move up in the image list for the active side, and "Shift + Down
Arrow" to move down in the image list for the active side.  The same
shortcuts apply in the color compare panel.
</p>
<p>
See the <a href="overview.html#keyboard_shortcuts">overview</a> for
application-wide keyboard shortcut information.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h2">
<h2>Hiding, Showing, and Deleting Images; Dual Scrolling and Dual zooming</h2>
<p>
Hiding and showing images, deleting images, and dual scrolling and
dual zooming work the same as they do for
the <a href="colorCompare.html">Color Compare Panel</a>.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h2">
<a name="zoom_caveat"></a>
<h2>Zoom to fit, zoom to width, and zoom to height for square images</h2>
<p>
Zoom to fit, zoom to width, and zoom to height may not perform quite
as expected for square images.  For the semi-technical reason, read
on.
</p>
<p>
If a square image is 10 squares wide, then the pixel width of that
image can only ever be a multiple of 10 pixels.  For example, if each
square is 2 pixels wide then the image will be 10*2 = 20 pixels wide,
or if each square is 5 pixels wide then the image will be 10*5 = 50
pixels wide, etc.  If the width available to display that square image
is 58 pixels, the program will display the image using the largest
square size that won't make the resulting image wider than 58 pixels,
which in this case means the square image will be scaled to be 50
pixels wide (leaving a gap of 8 pixels).  The same rule applies to
heights.
</p>
<p>
So square images may appear smaller than you expect them too - if you
really want them larger you can always zoom in.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h2">
<h2>Proceeding to the Symbol Editing Panel</h2>
<p>
Once satisfied with the pattern, <b>click on the image you wish to
proceed with</b> to select it (first choosing the Select tool if
necessary) and then click the <i>Pattern</i> button on the toolbar,
which will take you to the <a href="pattern.html">Symbol Editing
Panel</a>.
</p>

<p>
You can return to this panel, change your options, and click Pattern as
many times as you like.
