The linux version of Cstitch was compiled against a static LSB build
of QT using LSB tools (LSB stands for Linux Standard Base
(http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/lsb), a project
aimed at increasing portability across LSB-compliant distributions).

According to LSB's application checker
(http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/lsb/download),
this version of Cstitch should load on the systems listed below (or,
presumably, on more recent versions of those listed).  I obviously
haven't tested on all of the listed systems, so if you're running one
of the systems below and Cstitch fails to load, please let me know at
tomklein@users.sourceforge.net.
