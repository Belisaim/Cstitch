<div id="jpeg_issue" class="heading">Release Notes</div>
<p>
<b>NOTE: It seems that the Windows and Linux versions of the jpeg
library used to load jpeg images produce different images when they
load the same .jpg file (who knew?!? No really...).  This is an issue
with external libraries, and for now it means that some project files
saved on Windows may not load correctly or may give different results
on Linux (and vice versa).  If you use Windows and have no concern
about your project files being usable on Linux (or don't know what
Linux is), then don't worry about this, but if you'd like to be able
to share your projects with people who might be using Linux, then for
now at least I suggest you convert any jpg images to png images before
loading them in cstitch.</b>
