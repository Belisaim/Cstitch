Beta version 0.9.0 released on April 6, 2011.

NOTE: It seems that the Windows and Linux versions of the jpeg
library used to load jpeg images produce different images when they
load the same .jpg file (who knew?!? No really...).  This is an issue
with external libraries outside my control, and for now it means that
some project files saved on Windows may not load correctly or may give
different results on Linux (and vice versa).  If you use Windows and
have no concern about your project files being usable on Linux (or
don't know what Linux is), then don't worry about this, but if you'd
like to be able to share your files with people who might be using
Linux, then for now at least I suggest you convert any jpg images to
png images before loading them in cstitch (.png's seem to load
consistently on Windows and linux).
