NOTE: It seems that the Windows and Linux versions of the jpeg library
used to load jpeg images produce different images when they load the
same .jpg file (who knew?!? No really...).  This is an issue with
external libraries, and for now it means that some project files saved
on Windows may not load correctly or may give different results on
Linux (and vice versa).  If you use Windows and have no concern about
your project files being usable on Linux (or don't know what Linux
is), then don't worry about this, but if you'd like to be able to
share your projects with people who might be using Linux, then for now
at least I suggest you convert any jpg images to png images before
loading them in cstitch.

All executables are packed using the UPX packer
(http://upx.sourceforge.net/) to make them smaller (about 40% of the
original size!).  Run the program as though you weren't aware of this.
