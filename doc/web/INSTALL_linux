Compiling Cstitch from source on Linux.


1.  Install the QT (gui toolkit) headers and libraries.

On Debian-based systems the package you're after is probably called
libqt4-dev - it provides the QT header files and pulls in the required
librairies and build tools.
From a terminal (as root):
     apt-get install libqt4-dev
(If you're not using a Debian-based distribution you'll need to
replace apt-get with your distribution's package installer, and the name of
the qt development package may be different for your distribution.)
     
2.  Download the CStitch source files.

It's possible to download the files as a tarball from the project
page (the "snapshot" link at
http://cstitch.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=cstitch/cstitch;a=summary),
but I recommend you download them instead as a git repository.
Downloading in repository form will make it simple to update to the
latest version at any time.

To populate the initial git repository (run one time only):
     git clone git://cstitch.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/cstitch/cstitch

The git command will create a directory named cstitch and download the
latest version of the CStitch files into that directory.

If you decide you want to download a new version of the CStitch files
at some later point, just run 'git pull' from the cstitch directory
and all files will be updated to the latest version.

3.  Download the program icon files.
Download the icons zip file from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/cstitch/files/Cstitch/Icons/
and unzip it in the cstitch/icons/ directory.

4.  Generate the documentation.
From the cstitch directory run 'doc/createDocs.py'.

5.  Generate the build files.
From the cstitch directory run the following:
     qmake -project (generates a cstitch.pro file)
     progen (adds some options to the cstitch.pro file)
     qmake (generates a Makefile based on the cstitch.pro contents)

6.  Compile.
From the cstitch directory run 'make' (generates the 'cstitch' executable).
