<h1 id="pattern">The Pattern Edit Panel</h1>&nbsp;
<img src=":patternImage_active.png" />

<p>
The pattern edit panel allows you to change color symbols and to save
your pattern as a pdf.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> The pattern view shows a border around each symbol filled
with the color of the corresponding square - this is for on-screen
reference purposes and does not appear in the final pdf version of the
pattern.
</p>

<p>
The final pdf includes a title page showing the original image and the
square colored image, then the pattern itself, then a table
illustrating how to piece together the pattern pages, then a list of
symbol/color associations.  Any DMC colors are listed with their DMC
name and code; if a color is non-DMC then the code is the RGB value of
the color.  The count column lists the number of times a given color
is used in the pattern.
</p>

<div class="h2Div">
<h2>Choosing Your Image</h2>
<p>
If you have created more than one symboled image (by clicking
the <i>Pattern</i> button on the square edit panel more than once),
you can switch between your images by either selecting the desired
image from the pulldown menu on the toolbar or by choosing it from the
list in the <i>Images</i> menu.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h2Div">
<h2>Switching Between the Square and Symbol Views</h2>
<p>
To situate yourself on the symbol image, you can switch back and forth
between the symbol and square color views by clicking the right button
on the image or by clicking the <i>Switch Views</i>
button <img src=":switchImages.png" /> on the toolbar.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h2Div">
<h2>Using the image previewer</h2>
<p>
Because of the high zoom levels needed to be able to read pattern
symbols on the image, typically only a small portion of the symbol
image will be viewable at any one time.  To help orient yourself and
browse around the image you can use the image previewer in the upper
right corner of the screen.  It provides a smaller view of the entire
image with a red rectangle outlining the area of the symbol image
currently being viewed.  You can move the rectangle, and hence the
region of the symbol image being viewed, by clicking and/or dragging
on the preview image.  To switch between viewing the original image
and the squared image in the preview area, right click anywhere on the
preview image.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h2Div">
<h2>Changing a symbol</h2>
<p>
To change the symbol used for a given color, you can either click on
the symbol on the image or right click on the symbol in the symbol
list and choose <i>Change symbol</i>.  In either case you can choose a
new symbol from the symbol selection dialog, which allows you to
select from all remaining available symbols.
</p>

<!--<p>
If a symbol is already in use for a color, you can't select it
directly for use with a different color; instead you can assign the
first color an unused symbol (thereby freeing up the desired symbol)
and then assign the new color the just freed symbol.
</p>-->

<p>
The initial selection of symbols is based on color: darker colors
receive symbols with borders partially filled in, while lighter colors
have either no border or a border that isn't filled.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h2Div">
<h2>Saving a Pattern to a Pdf File</h2>
<p>
To save your pattern to a pdf, click the <i>To pdf</i> button on the toolbar.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b>The size of the symbols/squares in the saved pdf will
reflect the current zoom level of the onscreen image, so if you want
larger symbols in the pdf then zoom in on screen before saving (but be
aware that increasing the zoom level can significantly increase the
number of pdf pages).
</p>
</div>

<a id="pattern_keyboard_shortcuts"></a>
<h2>Keyboard shortcuts</h2>
<p>
You can press "Shift + Up Arrow" (i.e. hold down the shift key and
then press the up arrow) to move up in the image list and "Shift +
Down Arrow" to move down in the image list.  The same shortcuts apply
in the color compare and square edit panels.
</p>
<p>
See the <a href="overview.html#overview_keyboard_shortcuts">overview</a> for
application-wide keyboard shortcut information.

<div class="h2Div">
<h2>Gridding and grid color</h2>
<p>
Gridding and grid color are controlled just as for
the <a href="square.html">square edit panel</a>.
